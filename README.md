# 💻 My LeetCode Journey

I’ve always wanted to strengthen my problem-solving and DSA skills, so I decided to **document my learning journey** here.  
I follow **Striver** and **takeuforward** for tutorials and explanations. Whenever I get stuck, I watch their videos, understand the concept, and then implement it myself in VS Code.

## 🎯 Purpose of this Repo

- To **save my own solutions and methods** in one place.  
- To **track my progress** so I don’t forget concepts over time.  
- To **experiment and learn** different approaches for the same problem.  
- To **build a reference library** I can revisit whenever I need to revise or clarify my understanding.  

> Over time, it’s easy to forget details or mix up approaches. This repo is my personal safeguard against that.

## 📝 How I Work

1. Pick a problem from LeetCode.  
2. Try solving it myself.  
3. Watch Striver or takeuforward tutorials if I get stuck.  
4. Implement my own solution and commit it here.

- This is **my personal notebook** in code form—organized, clean, and revisitable.  
- Over time, this repo will reflect my **growth from beginner to confident problem solver**.
